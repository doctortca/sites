If you elect to have a new home built, your attendance will be required on several brief occasions. These meetings are for you, the home buyer, so that you can get all the facts and verify that construction is progressing as you expect.<p>

The occasions on which your attendance will be needed are as follows:<p>

<font size=3 color="30306F">1. Pre-Construction Conference</font><p>

After building permits and approvals have been obtained and before contruction can commence, you will attend a pre-construction meeting. You will meet your Construction Supervisor, who will oversee all phases of construction for your new home. At this meeting, you and the Contstruction Supervisor will review your contract, placement of your home on the lot, and existing tree locations.<p>

<font size=3 color="30306F">2. Pre-Drywall Construction Conference</font><p>

This meeting will be a walk-through of your home with your Construction Supervisor. You will review construction details and finishing details prior to the covering of the framework and review any change orders you might have.<p>

<font size=3 color="30306F">3. Pre-Settlement Conference<p></font>

This meeting will occur approximately 30 days before your scheduled closing or settlement date. This meeting is conducted to ensure that your home has been constructed as planned. Any final details will be handled during the next 30 days, so your attendance at this meeting is very important.<p>

<font size=3 color="30306F">4. New Home Orientation<p></font>

You will be walked through the house by your Construction Supervisor, who will instruct you how to use various appliances and systems that have been installed in your home.
