<font size=3 color="30306F">What costs are involved in obtaining a home loan?</font><p>

For obtaining a home loan, various costs can be accrued, including points, application fees, document preparation fees, and closing costs. This may include the cost to obtain your credit report (generally about $65) and the cost for an appraisal (usually around $250).<p>

<font size=3 color="30306F">How long does it take to obtain a home loan?</font><p>

The time period required to obtain a home loan can vary depending on you and your lender. The faster you can provide the lender with the appropriate paperwork and information, the sooner the approval process can begin. This process can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months.<p>

<a name="Needed Items"><font size=3 color="30306F">What will I need to get approved for a home loan?</font></a><p>

Lenders will ask you for a variety of items and information, including your last two years' tax returns, recent pay stubs, recent bank statements, account numbers for your other debts such as car loans and credit cards, profit sharing information, and your existing home loan account number if you already own a home or your landlord's contact information if you currently are in a rental.<p>

<font size=3 color="30306F">Who is involved in the loan process?</font><p>

There are several professionals who will be involved in processing your information during the loan approval process. The first is the loan officer, who will take your application. Next, the loan processor will gather from you all the necessary documents, other pertinent information, and associated fees. From there, an underwriter assesses the value of the property you want to purchase. This individual will also evaluate your financial history and will play a large part in determining whether or not you are a safe credit risk for the lender.<p>

<a name="Loan Types"><font size=3 color="30306F">What types of home loans are available?</font></a><p>

There are many types of home loans. These are:<p>
<UL>
<li>30-Year Fixed-Rate Mortgage - A mortgage which in which the borrower pays 12 equal payments per year over a 30-year period. The interest rate is "fixed" and will not increase or decrease over the life of the loan.<p>
<LI> 15-Year Fixed-Rate Mortgage - A mortgage which in which the borrower pays 12 equal payments per year over a 15-year period. Like the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate is also "fixed" and will not increase or decrease over the life of the loan. The 15-year option is a great alternative to the 30-year fixed rate for those who can afford to pay a small amount more each month for their home. The interest saved by cutting the loan re-payment period in half is considerable. <p>
<LI>Adjustable Rate Mortgage - An adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) is one that is known for its low starting interest rate, generally a point or two below the market rate. However, this type of mortgage is not generally recommended because after its introductory period, its interest rate is adjusted periodically based on the current interest rate and a preselected index. Often borrowers will wind up paying more interest in the long run than if they had chosen a fixed-rate mortgage.<p>
<LI>FHA Loans - These are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), a division of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The guidelines for obtaining an FHA loan are generally more lenient than guidelines for many other loans, making it easier for borrowers to qualify and gain approval.<p>
<LI>VA Loans - These are loans available for people who've been members of the U.S. military. One big advantage to VA loans is that often no down payment is required.<p>
</UL>

<font size=3 color="30306F">Should I lock-in my interest rate?</font><p>

If it will be a while before you close on your home, you may want to consider this option. Lockin-in an interest rate will allow you to benefit from today's interest rates tomorrow. This can be advantageous if rates are continuing or predicted to rise. Most lenders allow you to lock-in your interest rate 60 to 90 days from closing, and some will permit you to lock-in rates even farther out.<P>
