There are several steps to obtaining a home loan. They are:<p>

<font size=3 color="30306F">1. Choosing a Lender</font><p>

Shop around! Choosing a lender should not be taken lightly. Often, it is a decision that will be with you for many years. Your lender will take on an important role in helping you identify what types of loans will best fit your situation. You should take into consideration whether the lender's interest rates and fees are competitive. And more importantly, you should make certain that you feel comfortable with your lender. Talk to friends, coworkers, and family to find out what their experiences have been with specific lenders. Word of mouth is often the best way to find out whether a lender is worthy of your business.<p>

<font size=3 color="30306F">2. Qualifying</font><p>


The first step in obtaining a home loan is getting qualified. Your lender will need to see <a href="faq.html#Needed Items">several documents</a> in order for this process to get started. There may be costs involved in getting qualified, such as application fees for costs associated with obtaining your credit report. After your lender has all the finanical information from you, it usually takes 1 week to 1 month to get qualified.<p>


<font size=3 color="30306F">3. Choosing a Loan Type</font><p>

There are a variety of <a href="faq.html#Loan Types">loan types</a> you can choose from. A home is likely the largest investment you'll ever make, so you'll want to research your loan options carefully. Your loan officer can help you make the most informed decision.<p>

<font size=3 color="30306F">4. Loan Processing</font><p>

The loan processing stage is where all your necessary paperwork and financial history is reviewed. It is at this state that your lender determines whether or not you are a good credit risk.<p>

<font size=3 color="30306F">5. Closing/Settlement </font><p>

The final stage of obtaining your home loan is the closing or settlement stage. It is best to be as prepared as you possibly can for this event, because a lot will be taking place. Closing will occur at the company which will insure the title on your home. You'll sign lots of paperwork, making sure to verify all the numbers and fees are consistent with your calculations as you go. You will also pay your first month's interest in advance at this time. Perhaps the most significant part of closing is the exchange of your down payment for the title of the home. In order for this to happen, your lender must also supply the title company with check for the remainder of your loan. As a result, for the next 15 to 30 years, you will repay your lender for paying off your home. And, the best part about closing is, after it is all over, the title to the home is now in your name!<p>
