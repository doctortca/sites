          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12">Considerable time can be
          spent on research (acquiring distance education books, articles, web
          sites, and other materials), so it is good to gather those resources
          and place them in a common repository (like our <a href="design_lib.htm">Design
          Library</a>) for other team members and future staff to refer to.</li>

              <p style="margin-top: 12">Advice by Margaret Driscoll:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p style="margin-top: 12">&quot;It
      is easy to lose sight of the importance of the principles of adult
      education when caught up in the necessary tools and technology inherent in
      WBT approaches.&quot;</li>
                <li>
                  <p style="margin-top: 12">&quot;Web-based training is about training. This seems
      obvious, but it is not always clear in many WBT programs. It is too easy
      to be caught up in the hype and hoopla of the technology and to lose sight
      of designing effective training. As educators, we must realize that this
      is just another form of instructional technology.&quot;</li>

          people will say when you increase interactivity in WBT, you invariably
          increase cost. But consider this: What will happen if you *don’t*
          include interactivity? Retention and course success will likely be
          low.</li>

          expect your SMEs to design the content for you. While they must be
          involved in course development, they shouldn't be asked to
          &quot;design&quot; a course alone. SMEs are experts in their
          respective subjects, but when it comes to instructional design, they:

              don’t structure the content (but rather use a “throw-up”
              approach)</li>

          and use resources (people) wisely - the better quality people

        <li>
          <p style="margin-top: 12">Avoid common development pitfalls:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p style="margin-top: 12">Moving content from one medium to
              another is not as easy as it sounds - Customers should be aware
              that redesign must occur when moving any kind of training between
              formats (requires rewriting &amp; restructuring content, substituting detail,
              locating &amp; even recreating original source files, developing
              interactions, and so forth)</li>
            <li>
              <p style="margin-top: 12">Choosing the software tools too soon -
              The problem here is that you must work in &quot;reverse&quot;.
              Insist on defining the gaps and conducting an analysis of training
              needs before purchasing tools.</li>
            <li>
              <p style="margin-top: 12">Adding a WBT assignment to your already
              busy workload - Treating a WBT project or pilot like an
              extra-curricular activity does not do it justice.</li>
            <li>
              <p style="margin-top: 12">Underestimating the complexity - In WBT
              development, there are a large number of dependent tasks and a need for lots of
              human resources. It also takes longer than most people think to
              develop WBT.</li>
            <li>
              <p style="margin-top: 12">Dedicating too little time to
              instructional aspects - Developers spend a disproportionate amount
              of time worrying about technical issues when they should be
              worried about the design of the instruction</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p style="margin-top: 12">Consider the following challenges when
          taking on large development or conversion efforts (for many courses at
          once): 
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p style="margin-top: 12">A great deal of variance can occur among
              team members in processes and products</li>
            <li>
              <p style="margin-top: 12">Frustration can occur if roles and
              responsibilities of team members are not clarified</li>
            <li>
              <p style="margin-top: 12">Logistics (resources, plans, policies,
              budgets) are often secondary to development. Failure to pay
              attention to these aspects early on will eventually terminate or
              severely cripple the entire project.</li>
