      show that students have a much higher knowledge-retention rate when
      content is presented in a variety of media. This is not only due to
      research on individual learning styles (our tendency to “prefer” or
      respond better to one presentation method over another), but also to the
      fact that students actually learn more when presented with information
      that stimulates more than one of their senses. The reason is that as our
      brains process incoming information, cognitive pathways are created in the
      brain that allow us later to retrieve that information. The more pathways
      created for a specific piece of information, the easier it will be for us
      to recall that information later. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This puts
      PRIMEDIA in a unique position. We already have thousands of video-based
      titles that do just that. They promote high retention rates and motivation
      by stimulating multiple senses through great visuals and audio. <o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">But we can
      take that one step further. With the advent of the Internet, we have a
      whole new world of opportunity open to us.<o:p>

      of the best methods for stimulating a variety of senses is WBT, which can stimulate not only visual and
      auditory processing in the brain through use of video, audio, animation,
      graphics, and text, but also can help students practice and apply what
      they’ve learned through frequent interactivity.</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p>
