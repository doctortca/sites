      <p>In order for us to move at the increasingly fast pace of the Internet,
      we must modify traditional development methods to meet our customer
      demands and short timeframes.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .25in; margin-left: 0">To
      do this, we propose using a &quot;rapid development&quot; process. This
      will help us to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .25in; margin-left: 0">Avoid
          “analysis paralysis”</li>
        <li>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .25in; margin-left: 0">Involve
          customers early and often</li>
        <li>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .25in; margin-left: 0">Provide
          successful solutions without lots of development time</li>
        <li>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .25in; margin-left: 0">Move
          design and development into real-world contexts, whereby testing can occur
          right away</li>
      </ul>
      <p><font color="#999999" face="Arial"><b>rapid development methods</b></font></p>
      <p>To help us achieve the goals above, we propose using the following methods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Condensed &quot;Design, Development, &amp; Test&quot; process (as opposed to
          the traditional ISD or &quot;ADDIE&quot; model):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Lump together the Analyze &amp; Design steps into a shorter
              &quot;Design&quot; phase, and the Implement &amp; Evaluate steps
              into a &quot;Test&quot; phase.&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Apply good instructional design
              principles where possible, even though phases are lumped together</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Keep customer fully involved through the entire cycle, because
              this eliminates the possibility of miscommunication and unmet
              expectations&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Can still perform *brief* analyses during the Design phase,
              just keep them high-level (only do what's absolutely
              necessary)&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Development of online &quot;Vertical&quot; and
          &quot;Horizontal&quot; prototypes (as opposed to
          detailed storyboards and flowcharts) for an accelerated design phase:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Vertical - one entire module completed online</li>
            <li>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Horizontal - whole course shell developed
              online, but no content</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>We have a variety of product types that we support. Based on the above
      methodologies, the following are our proposed processes for the various
      product types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><a href="../../ResearchLibrary/Prod_Dev/tasks_ss.pdf"> Straight Media Streams</a></p>
          <p>(for <font color="#000080"><b> conversion from &quot;edutainment&quot; &amp; &quot;infotainment&quot;</b></font>
          <font color="#000080"><b>videos</b></font>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a href="../../ResearchLibrary/Prod_Dev/Tasks_conversion.pdf"> Interactive
          WBT</a></p>
          <p>(for <font color="#000080"><b> conversion from instructional videos</b></font>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a href="../../ResearchLibrary/Prod_Dev/Tasks_NEW.pdf">Custom Interactive
          WBT</a></p>
          <p>(for <font color="#000080"><b>custom or original development</b></font>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>WebCasts&nbsp;</p>
          <p>(for <b><font color="#000080">live, simulcast discussions and
          courses</font></b>)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>Please note: The processes above may vary per project and are
      dependent on previously defined processes within each network. In
      addition, if working with vendors, their processes will have to be taken
      into consideration as well.</i></p>

      <p>One thing to consider when developing WBT as opposed to other types of
      training is that WBT takes more time to develop.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Development time is even longer for WBT than it is for CBT. CBT tools
      are generally slicker and faster for development than the
      open-architecture WBT tools we must use today. Why is this the case? While
      open-architecture means greater compatibility between platforms (and
      tools), it also means the tools don't have the advanced features,
      functionality, and flexibility on the development end that more
      proprietary CBT tools have. The same end results can be achieved for WBT,
      however, but they require considerably more back-end programming and time.</p>
      <p>Take a look at the average <a href="timeframes.pdf">WBT development
      timeframes (Adobe PDF document)</a> reported in the industry today.</p>
      <p><font color="#999999" face="Arial"><b>our timeframes</b></font></p>
      <p>Because the online training market is new to PRIMEDIA, it will be
      difficult to provide precise time estimates for converting courses or
      creating new content at this time. Once we have more experience working
      together as an organization (and with vendors) as well as have a good
      understanding of each network's internal development and approval
      processes, realistic time estimates can be provided.</p>
      <p>Until then, please view PRIMEDIA's <a href="time_estimates.pdf">estimated
      WBT development timeframes (Adobe PDF document)</a> as a general guide.</p>
